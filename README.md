## FAQ

#### Command 'docker' not found, but can be installed with

Docker is not installed on your machine. You may install either docker or podman:

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
* [podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)

> After installing podman, you need to [configure registries.conf](https://podman.io/docs/installation#registriesconf) to use Docker Hub by default; otherwise, image pulling will fail.
> Docker installation includes `docker compose`; if you use podman, you need to install `docker-compose-v2` separately. You may ask AI: How to use docker compose based on podman socket?

#### cannot listen on the TCP port: listen tcp4 :5432: bind: address already in use

PostgreSQL is already running on your machine. You can change `PG_PORT` in `.env` to another port, such as `5433`, then restart.
